# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Tools Overview

This section outlines commonly used tools in a Security Operations Center (SOC), categorized by their function within security operations.

## üìä 1. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

- **Elastic Security**
- **graylog**
- **Azure Sentinel (Microsoft)**

- Log Management
- Real-time Monitoring
- Alerting & Notification
- Incident Response
- Dashboards, Reports & Visualization
- Threat Intelligence Integration
  
**Use Case:** Centralized log management, alerting, and compliance reporting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2.  SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
Automates repetitive SOC tasks and streamlines incident workflows.

- **IBM Resilient**
- **Splunk SOAR (Phantom)**
- **IBM Radar**
-  **tines**
-  **LogRhythm**
-  **blink**

- Orchestration- Workflows, Collaboration
- Automation- Alert triage, Artifact collection, Data enrichment
- Incident Response- Access & prioritize
- Integration- TIPs, EDR, firewalls
- Analytics & Intelligence
- Reporting
   
**Use Case:** Incident response automation, playbook execution, alert triage.

## üö® 3. Incident Management Tools
Organizes and tracks incidents through their lifecycle ‚Äî detection, investigation, response, and closure.

- **Servicenow**
- **freshworks**
- **onpage**

- Incident Ticketing- Documentation, Tracking, Assigning
- Alert Management
- Workflow Automation
- Collabpration
  
  
**Use Case:**

  ## üåê 4.  NSM (Network Security Monitoring)
   Monitors network traffic for suspicious or malicious activity.
- **Zeek (formerly Bro)**
- **Suricata**
- **Snort**
- **Wireshark**
- **Security Onion** *(includes multiple NSM tools)*

**Use Case:** Detecting lateral movement, intrusion detection, traffic inspection.

## üíª 5. EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
Provides visibility into endpoint activities and enables threat detection, investigation, and response.

- **CrowdStrike Falcon**
- **SentinelOne**
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**
- **Trend Micro Vision One**
- **Sophos Intercept X**
**Use Case:**

  ## üíª 6. Firewalls(Network Firewalls, Next-Generation Firewalls NGFW, Web Application Firewalls WAF)
