# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Tools Overview

This section outlines commonly used tools in a Security Operations Center (SOC), categorized by their function within security operations.

## üìä 1. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

Used for collecting, analyzing, and correlating logs to detect security incidents.

- **Splunk**
- **IBM QRadar**
- **solarwinds**
- **LogRhythm**
- **Elastic Security**
- **graylog**
- **Azure Sentinel (Microsoft)**

**Use Case**-
- Log Management
- Real-time Monitoring
- Alerting & Notification
- Incident Response
- Dashboards, Reports & Visualization
- Threat Intelligence Integration
  
**Use Case in Short:** Centralized log management, alerting, and compliance reporting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2.  SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
Automates repetitive SOC tasks and streamlines incident workflows.

- **IBM Resilient**
- **Splunk SOAR (Phantom)**
- **IBM Radar**
-  **tines**
-  **LogRhythm**
-  **blink**

**Use Case**-
- Orchestration- Workflows, Collaboration
- Automation- Alert triage, Artifact collection, Data enrichment
- Incident Response- Access & prioritize
- Integration- TIPs, EDR, firewalls
- Analytics & Intelligence
- Reporting
   
**Use Case in Short:** Incident response automation, playbook execution, alert triage.

## üö® 3. Incident Management Tools
Organizes and tracks incidents through their lifecycle ‚Äî detection, investigation, response, and closure.

- **ATLASSIAN**
- **Servicenow**
- **freshworks**
- **onpage**

**Use Case**-
- Incident Ticketing- Documentation, Tracking, Assigning
- Alert Management
- Workflow Automation
- Collabpration
  
  
**Use Case in Short:**

  ## üåê 4.  NSM (Network Security Monitoring)
   Monitors network traffic for suspicious or malicious activity.
   
- **Zeek (formerly Bro)**
- **Suricata**
- **Snort**
- **Wireshark**
- **Security Onion** *(includes multiple NSM tools)*
- **Nagios**

**Use Case**-
- Packet Capture & Analysis- Real time or with captures
- Network Traffic Analysis- statistical analysis, Machine learning, Behavior analysis
- Intrusion Detection- IDS functionality
- Integration with SIEM- Correlate network events with endpoint telemetry

**Use Case in Short:** Detecting lateral movement, intrusion detection, traffic inspection.

## üíª 5. EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
Provides visibility into endpoint activities and enables threat detection, investigation, and response.

- **Crowdstrike**
- **SOPHOS**
- **Carbon Black**
- **SentinelOne**

**Use Case**-
- Real-time Endpoint Monitoring
- User Entity Behavior Analytics(UEBA)
- Threat Detection & Prevention
- Incident Investigation
- Remediation & Response
- Integration with SIEM
  
**Use Case in Short:**

  ## üíª 6. Firewalls(Network Firewalls, Next-Generation Firewalls NGFW, Web Application Firewalls WAF)
  Monitor and Control incoming and outgoing network traffic.

  - **paloalto**
  - **sonicwall**
  - **pfsense**
  - **juniper**
  - **Clouseflare**

**Use Case**-
- Network Firewalls- Examine packets, layer 3, Make decisions based on rules.
- Next-Generation Firewalls(NGFW)- Stateful packet insepection, Deep packet insepection, layer 7
- Web Application Firewalls- Inspect HTTP(S) traffic, protect web applications from attacks, layer 7
- 

  ## 7. Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems(IDS/IPS)
  Detects or Prevents malicious activity (IDS/IPS).
  - pfSense (Firewall)  
- Cisco ASA / Fortinet / Palo Alto Firewalls  
- Snort (IDS/IPS)  
- Suricata (IDS/IPS)  
- OSSEC (HIDS)  

 ## üß† 8.  Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP)
 Aggregates and analyzes threat intelligence data (IOCs, malware indicators) to support threat detection.
- **MISP (Open-source)**
- **OPENCTI**
- **MALTEGO**   
- **Recorded Future**

**Use Case**-
- Data Aggregation & Enrichment
- Indicators of compromise(IOCs)
- Normalization & standardization
- Analysis & Prioritization
- Integreation with SIEM
- 
## üß¨ 9. Forensic Analysis Tools
Supports post-incident investigations by analyzing digital evidence.
- **Autopsy**  
- FTK (Forensic Toolkit)  
- EnCase  
- Volatility (Memory analysis)  
- X-Ways Forensics  

**Use Case**-
- Data Acuisition & Imagaing
- Files system Analysis
- Memory Forensics
- Registry Forensics
- Network traffic forensics
- 
## ü¶† 10. Malware Analysis Tools
Used to analyze, reverse-engineer, and understand malware behavior.
 Ghidra (NSA reverse engineering tool)  
- IDA Pro  
- Cuckoo Sandbox  
- Any.Run  
- VirusTotal
- HYBRID ANALYSIS
- CHIDRA
