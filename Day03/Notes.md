# Notes: Security Operations Center (SOC) and Its Role

## 📌 What is a SOC?

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level. It is responsible for **monitoring, detecting, preventing, and responding to cybersecurity threats** in real-time.

## 🧩 Key Components of a SOC

1. **People**
   - Security Analysts (Tier 1, 2, 3)
   - Incident Responders
   - Threat Hunters
   - SOC Manager

2. **Processes**
   - Incident detection and response
   - Threat intelligence integration
   - Security event correlation
   - Compliance and reporting

3. **Technology**
   - SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
   - EDR/XDR (Endpoint/Extended Detection and Response)
   - Firewalls, IDS/IPS
   - SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
   - Threat Intelligence Platforms

## 🎯 Main Functions of a SOC

- **Continuous Monitoring**
  - 24/7 surveillance of systems and networks
- **Incident Detection**
  - Real-time identification of anomalies and threats
- **Incident Response**
  - Containment, eradication, and recovery
- **Threat Hunting**
  - Proactive search for hidden threats
- **Forensics**
  - Root cause analysis and digital evidence gathering
- **Compliance Monitoring**
  - Ensure adherence to regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, NIST)

## 🔄 SOC Operation Tiers

- **Tier 1 – Alert Triage**
  - Monitor dashboards, escalate alerts.
- **Tier 2 – Incident Response**
  - Investigate incidents, determine scope.
- **Tier 3 – Threat Hunting**
  - Proactively detect advanced threats.
- **SOC Manager**
  - Oversees operations, reporting, compliance.
