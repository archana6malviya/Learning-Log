## Date

## ‚úÖ What I Did Today
- A **hypervisor** is software that creates and manages our VM`s and lets you run multiple operating systems on the same hardware.
- Oracle VirtualBox- **Type-2 hypervisor**, which runs on top of an existing OS (like Windows or macOS).It is free, easy to install and highly featured.
- You can install guest operating systems like Windows 10 or Ubuntu inside VirtualBox.
- Clone git repositery to our both VM's.
- Configured Windows & Ubantu for future use.
- For Ubantu Machine- by installing the guest edition image, we can increase the screen resolution and allow for things like the shared clipboard.
- Also Installed some packages and dependencies.

## üí° Why This Matters
Setting up a safe, isolated environment is crucial for ethical hacking and cybersecurity testing. A virtual lab helps prevent harm to your actual system and allows you to simulate attacks legally.

## üß† Key Concepts
- **VM (Virtual Machine)**: An emulated computer system.
- **ISO File**: A disk image used to install operating systems.
- **VDI (Virtual Disk Image)**: VirtualBox's default format for virtual hard drives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
| Tool           | Version         | Notes                        |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Oracle VirtualBox | 7.2.2     | Installed on Windows 10     |
| Windows 10 ISO | 21H2 (64-bit)     | From Microsoft site          |
| Ubuntu ISO     | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | From ubuntu.com              |
| Clone Git Repositery | 2.51.0 for Windows | From git-scm.com  |

## üí° Tips for Future
- Always allocate enough RAM (minimum 2 GB for Ubuntu, 4 GB for Windows).
- Use **Guest Additions** in VirtualBox for better display/resolution.
- Took snapshots before doing big changes in VMs.
- Clone repository to computer.
