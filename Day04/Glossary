- **Bandwidth** – Maximum data transfer capacity of a network (bits per second).  
- **Cloud Computing** – Using internet-based servers and apps instead of local devices.  
- **Cloud Network** – Remote servers that store and manage data via the internet.  
- **Data Packet** – Basic unit of data sent over a network.  
- **Hub** – Sends data to all connected devices in a network.  
- **Internet Protocol (IP)** – Rules for routing and addressing data packets.  
- **IP Address** – Unique identifier for a device on the internet.  
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** – Network within a small area like a home or office.
