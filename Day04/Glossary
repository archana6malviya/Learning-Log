## 🌐 Network Terms (Quick Notes)

- **Bandwidth** – Max data transfer capacity (bits per second).  
- **Cloud Computing** – Using internet-hosted servers and apps instead of local devices.  
- **Cloud Network** – Servers storing data/resources in remote data centers accessible online.  
- **Data Packet** – Basic unit of info sent across a network.  
- **Hub** – Broadcasts data to all devices on a network.  
- **Internet Protocol (IP)** – Rules for routing and addressing data packets.  
- **IP Address** – Unique identifier for a device on the internet.  
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** – Network within a small area (home, office, school).  
- **MAC Address** – Unique hardware ID for a network device.  
- **Modem** – Connects the router to the internet.  
- **Network** – A group of connected devices.  
- **OSI Model** – 7-layer framework for network communication.  
- **Packet Sniffing** – Capturing and analyzing data packets.  
- **Port** – Software-based endpoint for sending/receiving data.  
- **Router** – Connects multiple networks and directs traffic.  
- **Speed** – Data transfer rate (bits per second).  
- **Switch** – Forwards data between specific devices on a LAN.  
- **TCP/IP Model** – 4-layer model for data transmission.  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – Connection-oriented data streaming.  
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** – Connectionless, faster but less reliable data transfer.  
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – Network spanning large geographic areas.
