what a network is. A network is a group of connected devices.

The devices on a network can communicate with each other over network cables, or wireless connections.

Devices need to find each other on a network to establish communications. 
These devices will use unique addresses, or identifiers, to locate each other. 
The addresses will ensure that communications happens with the right device. 
These are called the IP and MAC addresses. 
Devices can communicate on two types of networks: 
a local area network, also known as a LAN, and a wide area network, also known as a WAN.
A local area network, or LAN, spans a small area like an office building, a school, or a home. For example, when a personal device like your cell phone or tablet connects to the WIFI in your house, they form a LAN. 

A wide area network or WAN spans a large geographical area like a city, state, or country.

**🧩 Network Devices**
🔌 1. Hub

Connects multiple computers in a network.

Broadcasts data to all devices (no intelligence).

Layer: 1 – Physical Layer.

Limitation: Causes network congestion and collisions.

🔀 2. Switch

Connects devices within a LAN and forwards data only to the intended device.

Uses MAC addresses for communication.

Layer: 2 – Data Link Layer.

Benefit: Reduces collisions and increases efficiency.

🌐 3. Router

Connects different networks (e.g., LAN to Internet).

Routes data using IP addresses.

Layer: 3 – Network Layer.

Benefit: Directs traffic efficiently and supports NAT, DHCP, and security policies.

🧱 4. Firewall

Monitors and filters traffic based on security rules.

Protects internal network from unauthorized access.

Layer: 3–7.

Benefit: Enforces network security at the perimeter or host level.

🌍 5. Modem

Converts digital signals to analog and vice versa for Internet access.

Layer: 1 – Physical Layer.

Use: Connects local network to the ISP.

🧠 6. Access Point (AP)

Provides wireless connectivity to devices.

Extends wired network using Wi-Fi.

Layer: 2 – Data Link Layer.

Use: Offices, homes, and public Wi-Fi zones.

🔄 7. Bridge

Connects two LAN segments to manage traffic.

Uses MAC addresses to forward data.

Layer: 2 – Data Link Layer.

📡 8. Gateway

Acts as a translator between networks using different protocols.

Layer: 3–7.

Use: Connects an enterprise network to external systems (e.g., Internet).

🕹️ 9. Repeater

Boosts or regenerates weak signals.

Layer: 1 – Physical Layer.

Use: Extends network distance.
| Device       | Layer | Function Summary                | Example Use Case            |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Hub          | 1     | Broadcasts all data             | Small, legacy networks      |
| Switch       | 2     | Forwards by MAC address         | LAN traffic control         |
| Router       | 3     | Routes packets between networks | Connect LAN to Internet     |
| Firewall     | 3–7   | Blocks/filters unwanted traffic | Network perimeter defense   |
| Modem        | 1     | Connects to ISP                 | Home Internet access        |
| Access Point | 2     | Wireless connectivity           | Office Wi-Fi                |
| Bridge       | 2     | Connects LAN segments           | Segment traffic             |
| Gateway      | 3–7   | Protocol translation            | Connect dissimilar networks |
| Repeater     | 1     | Extends signal range            | Extend network distance     |

Virtualization tools are pieces of software that perform network operations. Virtualization tools carry out operations that would normally be completed by a hub, switch, router, or modem, and they are offered by Cloud service providers. These tools provide opportunities for cost savings and scalability.
